            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I am a current student in the Web Development Immersive program at Galvanize Denver. After years of plotting my escape from the world of professional fundraising events, I am so pleased to have begun this journey into the world of web development and am actively seeking an entry-level position using my new skills.

            I fill my free time playing in the great outdoors including climbing, hiking, and camping. I love to travel and have zig-zagged my way across Europe, lived in Spain and Scotland, but also enjoy a good old Denver staycation.</p>

            <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>
            I got into coding for both the intellectual challenge and the opportunity to drive change on a grander scale than my previous, local work, in non-profits. I am highly detail-focused and love the precision that good code requires. I am looking to work at a small-mid sized company that focuses on a triple bottom line. Working on a project that combats climate change, has an outdoor industry connection, or just generally does good in the world would be a dream.
